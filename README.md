# Mean App Boilerplate

Boilerplate app built using:
- MongoDb
- ExpressJs
- AngularJs
- NodeJs


Prerequisites
-------------

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- [Mongodb] (https://www.mongodb.com)


Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Cone Repository
git clone https://github.com/tumbone/mean-app-boilerplate.git

# Change directory
cd mean-app-boilerplate


# Install Dependencies
npm install

# Start the Development Server
node server
```


**Note:** Consider installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. 
```bash
# To install, run
npm install -g nodemon
```

**Disclaimer:**
This app is a reconstruction of Nikola Bre≈ænjak's Mean Stack Tutorial which partly follows the structure from MEAN Web Development by Amos Haviv, the author of the MEAN.JS framework.
